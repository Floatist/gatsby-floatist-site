If you’ve got white sand beaches and picturesque villages in mind for your next vacation, the Southern Ionian Islands are the perfect destination for your next trip. The most common launching point is Lefkas, Greece, where you can catch flights to and from Athens, as well as international destinations. 

Lefkas is known as Lefkada to locals, and as you set sail keep in ind that many Greek places share similar names. It’s a good idea to always double check that you’re researching the right destination.

In Lefkas, Porto Katsiki is a must. This white sand beach is backed by a huge cliff. If you’re adventurous, you can easily hike to the Nydri waterfalls or tour the island by mountain bike. For the more relaxed traveler, wine tours are also an option. When you’re ready to set sail, consider this itinerary.1 

## Stop 1: Nikiana

Sail south along the coast to Nikiana, and dock for the night. There’s a town quay, or you can anchor.

What to see and do:
* Get used to the pace of the island: Slow down for some food and drink in the village’s tavernas.
* Take a trip inland to the nearby [Agios Georgios](http://www.wondergreece.gr/v1/en/Regions/Lefkada/Culture/Churches_Monasteries/6613-Monastery_of_Agios_Georgios), a small but rustic church from the 16th or 17th century.
* Learn to scuba at the [Lefkas Diving Center](http://www.lefkasdivingcenter.gr/)


## Stop 2: Ayia Eufimia

Sail south to Kefalonia Island and dock at the town of Ayia Eufimia.

What to see and do:
* Stock up on any needed provisions, since Ayia Eufimia is one of the bigger towns on this itinerary.
* Visit the Cave of Melissani, an underground lake. This lake is fed by a stream flowing from Argostoli on the other side of the island. If you’re adventurous, sail along this stream on a rowboat with a guide.
* Hike around the [Monastery of Themata](https://www.greeka.com/ionian/kefalonia/sightseeing/monastery-themata/).

**Tip**: The harbor is hard to spot from the sea, and moorings fill up early in the afternoon. Try to get here early if you can. When researching, be sure you look at Sivotas on Lefkas Island, not Sivota on the coast near Korfu.
